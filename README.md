STX Insider
===========

In-house Android application which presents STXNext teams & projects.
Thanks to the mobile app our clients can stay up-to-date with the news, conferences, events
and presentations we do at STXNext. The app is also helpful in navigating to and from the company headquarters.

# Summary
STXInsider is written in Kotlin which is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. In July 2011 JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM. Stable release was publishe in Feb 2016. JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compile time of Scala as its obvious deficiency. Kotlin is designed to be fully interoperable with Java code, allowing companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin.
